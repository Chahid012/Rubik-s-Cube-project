# Rubik-s-Cube-project

## Project goal

**Final Objective:** Program a robot to solve a Rubik's Cube.

**Step 1:** Development of a program for manual control of the robot through dedicated functions.

**Step 2:** Design of an algorithm to capture images of the cube's faces and convert them into a color array.

**Step 3:** Use of a matrix representing the six faces of the Rubik's Cube to devise the solution. The end result is a sequence of detailed steps for solving the cube.
